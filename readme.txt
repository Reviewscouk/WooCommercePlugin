### What are Google Seller Ratings?

[Google Seller Ratings](https://www.reviews.io/front/google-seller-ratings?utm_source=woocommerce&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=apps-modules&utm_content=google-seller-ratings) are the stars you see around the web when you search for products and companies on Google. They appear under Adwords ads, in Google Shopping product listing adverts, and in organic search results. Google Seller Ratings give your company a mind-boggling 17% increase in clicks to your site, meaning more traffic and sales. Google Seller Ratings are only achievable by collecting Company and Product reviews with a licensed Google Review Partner like REVIEWS.io.
