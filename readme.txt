### REVIEWS.io: A Feature-rich Review Solution: 

**User-Generated Content (UGC) -** Enhance your UGC collection by requesting photo or video reviews in your review invites. [Make your UGC Shoppable](https://blog.reviews.io/post/combine-manage-ugc-into-shoppable-galleries) by adding your Product Catalog to the DataFeed within the WooCommerce Plugin. This allows your review content to convert by tagging the product mentioned in the review to direct them to the Product Page.   

**Reputation Manager -** To ensure a consistent reputation across different third-party review platforms, utilize REVIEWS.io’s [Reputation Manager Tool](https://www.reviews.io/front/reputation-management) to send a portion of review invitations specifically to these platforms. This approach enables you to manage your online presence by maintaining a uniform review rating across platforms like Trustpilot, Facebook, and Google Local.

**Review Attributes -** Create strong customer profiles and help browsers make more informed purchasing decisions by [displaying attributes](https://blog.reviews.io/post/how-to-make-review-attributes-work-for-your-brand-with-our-6-top-use-case-examples) next to the product reviews. For example, a clothing company may showcase whether the item was ‘true-to-fit’ to help to convert browsers into buyers. Simply connect your Product Catalog to the data feed within your WordPress dashboard at the settings for the REVIEWS.io WooCommerce plugin.

**Influence.io -** A REVIEWS.io company, which is a platform that allows eCommerce merchants to add a [loyalty program](https://www.influence.io/) to their website. Influence.io offers an earn & rewards points system, a referrals program, loyalty tiers, and create an affiliate marketing program.
